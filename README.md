# Food-Bank-CENC-Link2Feed
Repo for entire Link2Feed analysis project for Food Bank of CENC

These are the scripts for the final product of the Food Bank of CENC multi-page Dash app. 
The app is an interactive dashboard that has in interactive map, tables, bar charts, and choropleth maps. 

This project used Jupyter notebooks, python, Dash, Plotly, pandas, geopandas, geoJSON, geopy, bootstrap, Folium, and others. 

The purpose of the project was to present locations of Food Bank clients in relation to food pantries in the area of operations
owned by the Food Bank of CENC. The data was represented geospatially, which enabled locating service area gaps. Once gaps are 
identified, action can be taken to add services in areas where there formerly was none. This has real-world impact 
which helps reduce food insecurity amongst vulnerable populaitons.
